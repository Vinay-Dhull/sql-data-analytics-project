# üìä Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

This project showcases a complete **end-to-end Data Warehouse and Advanced Analytics pipeline** built using Microsoft SQL Server, following best practices of **Medallion Architecture**.

---

## üöÄ Project Structure

### 1. Data Ingestion  
Raw ERP and CRM data (CSV files) were loaded and cleaned to form the **Bronze Layer**.

### 2. Data Transformation & Modeling  
Created normalized and enriched tables in the **Silver Layer**.  
Applied **Star Schema** modeling with Fact and Dimension tables in the **Gold Layer**.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Performed key business explorations:
- Dimensions & Measures
- Date Range Exploration
- Ranking & Performance Analysis
- Cumulative & Change over Time Analysis
- Data Segmentation
- Part-to-Whole Analysis

### 4. Advanced Analytics Reports
- `12_report_customers.sql`: In-depth customer trends and KPIs  
- `13_report_products.sql`: Product-wise sales, orders, and performance
